It is a single tool that can be used to monitor and manage any and all operations involving a companyâ€™s data and projects within its Information Security Management System (ISMS).
                        The vision for this project is to create an easy-to-use application with a user-friendly interface where an organization can have access to all their users, data scopes, support related queries/issues, risk reports and tasks.
                        Users will be assigned certain roles when their profile has been created on the application. These roles are defined by a set of permissions within the application, this is to manage data access as well as to assign administrative rights to certain users.</p>
